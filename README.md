# Data-Structures

Implementation of data structures using C++ 

C++ - is a general-purpose programming language created by Bjarne Stroustrup as an extension of the C programming language, or "C with Classes". The language has expanded significantly over time, and modern C++ now has object-oriented, generic, and functional features in addition to facilities for low-level memory manipulation.

* Linked List - A linked list is a linear data structure, in which the elements are not stored at contiguous memory locations. The elements in a linked list are linked using pointers

* Stacks - In computer science, a stack is an abstract data type that serves as a collection of elements, with two main principal operations:
            Push, which adds an element to the collection, and
            Pop, which removes the most recently added element that was not yet removed.
            
* Queue - In computer science, a queue is a collection of entities that are maintained in a sequence and can be modified by the addition of entities at one end of the sequence and the removal of entities from the other end of the sequence
